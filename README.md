# Sandbar Analysis

This is the GCMRC Sandbar Processing script repository. The code in this repo can be run as a standalone Python script or, more commonly, launched from the [GCMRC Sandbar Workbench](https://gcmrc.northarrowresearch.com/).

## Requirements

See the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file for a list of Python packages required to run this script. The script is designed to use Python 3 and the GDAL open source GIS software. See the file [scripts/bootsrap.sh](./scripts/bootstrap.sh) for an example of how to install these requirements on a unix based system. Check out the [Python configuration](https://gcmrc.northarrowresearch.com/Online_Help/Sandbar_Analysis/python_configuration.html) for Windows.

## Documentation

Documentation about this tool and how to use it is available on the wiki:

<http://gcmrc.northarrowresearch.com/>

## Usage

Call the `main.py` and pass an XML file describing all the inputs and outputs. This XML file is typically [generated by the Workbench software](https://gcmrc.northarrowresearch.com/Online_Help/Sandbar_Analysis/sandbar_analysis_run.html).

These Python scripts do not require either the Workbench or the Workbench SQLite database to operate.

## Change Log
